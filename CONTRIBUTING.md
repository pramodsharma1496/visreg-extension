# Contributing to VisReg

First off, thank you for considering contributing to VisReg! It’s people like you who make open-source tools great.

## 🛡️ Our Review Process
To maintain the quality and stability of the extension, we follow a strict review process:
1. **Branch Protection:** The `main` branch is protected. No one (including maintainers) can push code directly to `main`.
2. **Pull Requests (PRs):** All changes must be submitted via a Pull Request.
3. **Mandatory Approval:** At least one approval is required from a maintainer before a PR can be merged.
4. **Resolved Conversations:** All comments and discussion points must be resolved before merging.

## 🛠️ How to Contribute

### 1. Find an Issue
Look through the GitHub Issues to find something to work on, or open a new issue to discuss a feature or bug you've found.

### 2. Create a Branch
Please create a descriptive branch name for your work:
- For features: `feat/your-feature-name`
- For bugs: `fix/the-bug-name`

### 3. Make Your Changes
Ensure your code follows the existing project structure and uses the Manifest V3 standards.

### 4. Submit a Pull Request
When you're ready, submit a PR to the `main` branch. Provide a clear description of:
- What changes you made.
- Why these changes are necessary.
- Any testing you performed locally.

### 5. The Review
A maintainer will review your code. We may suggest changes or ask questions. Please ensure you address these and "Resolve" the conversations in the PR interface.

Once approved, your code will be merged into the project!
